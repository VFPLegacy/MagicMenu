# MagicMenu - Empowering Your Visual FoxPro Projects

MagicMenu is a tool designed to enhance and extend the capabilities of Visual FoxPro 9.0. With MagicMenu, you can create projects that were previously challenging to accomplish in VFP, such as Web Projects, Windows Services, and Console Applications.

## Key Features

- **Create Web Projects with [FoxServer](https://github.com/VFPLegacy/FoxServer):** MagicMenu allows you to create web _(API REST, HTML based)_ applications by using the FoxServer libraries that let you write your backend logic code in VFP.
- **Windows Services:** Effortlessly create Windows services for background tasks and process automation.
- **Console Applications:** Develop console applications for executing specific tasks via command-line interactions.
- **Native Interface:** MagicMenu runs in a native Fox menu and uses the native Project Manager with a Hook class called **MagicMenuProjectHook** that extends it's capabilities.

## Getting Started with MagicMenu

   - Download [MagicMenu](https://github.com/VFPLegacy/MagicMenu/releases/download/v1.0.1/MagicMenu-v101.app.zip) application.
